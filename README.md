      - name: Scan links
        id: scan-links
        uses: JustinBeckwith/linkinator-action@v1

#### How to custom your workflow

1. **Create workflow yaml file**

> [broken-link.yaml](./.github/workflows/broken-link.yaml) is a real workflow example for you.
change the value in `jobs.steps[1].with.paths` to which url you want to monitor. If more than one url that you want to monitor, please add a comma separated each url.

<br/>

2. **modify the issue template**

> when a broken link is detected, workflow will create a new bug issue. If you want to modify the issue template, please add a markdown file under `./github/` folder ([example file](./.github/broken-links-check-issue-template.md)):

```markdown
---
title: Some broken links detected
assignees: kwp-lab, garyli27, Javen-Woo
labels: bug
---

## üîç Broken Links check

there are several links are broken.

üëâ Please see the [action summary]({{ env.SUMMARY_LINK }})
```

<br/>

3. **How to ignore the special links we don't want to marked as broken links?**

> please modify the file `./github/linkinator.config.json`, append urls to the value of `skip` property :

```json
{
    "timeout": 5000,
    "verbosity": "error",
    "retry": 3,
    "skip": [
        "https://vika.cn/xmlrpc.php",
        "https://vika.cn/comments/feed/",
        "https://vika.cn/partners/",
        "https://apitable.com/comments/feed/",
        "https://apitable.com/void\\(0\\);",
        "https://beian.miit.gov.cn",
        "https://cn.idgcapital.com",
        "http://www.tiantu.com.cn/cn/index.aspx",
        "https://caicloud.io/",
        "https://ruanzu.com/"
    ]
}
```
